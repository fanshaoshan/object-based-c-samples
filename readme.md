# Object Base C Programming Excamples


This reporsitory provide sever example on how to write object based programming using c. The reason I call it "object based" is because "object oriented" is normally refer to a super set of OO functionality that been supported by common C++/Java.

Here is list of examples

## Object
Demo how to create one compoent as an object, support basic class variable and methods.

## inherit
Demo how to inherit from parent class by including parent structure as first element of child structure.

## interface
Demo how to implement a interface. Each instance will include a copy of vtable, simple but not memory efficient for large number of instances.

## interface_vtable
Demo how to implement a interface. All instance will have a pointer to one vtable. A little complicate but works well if you have large number of instances.

## polym
Demo how to implement polymorphism. One class, same class variable, behavior of same method will depend on type of instances.

## polym_inherit
Demo how to implement polymorphism with data inheritance.
